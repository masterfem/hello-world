# hello-world
this would be my first (actually second, but i didn't knew exactly how github worked the first time, so this ought to be my "real" first) repository, and i hope I'll be making more as I'll learn more
So I've been coding just tiny bits here and there for over 20 years, until I thought it would be a good idea to have a (at least at first) backup job doing something that I truly like, and this is my first serious attempt at this. Hopefully I can learn to code properly (specially about teamwork while coding, which is totally new for me and the main reason I've decided to learn Git/Github) in these colaborative environments, which appear to make coding a better experience.
